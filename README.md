# LeanSMILES
Formalizing molecular representations in Lean

## Installation

No Lean experience needed. Setup is a one-time job, and most of it is download
time. Two tools do the work: **elan** installs the right Lean version (much as
conda manages Python environments), and **lake** fetches dependencies and builds
the project.

1. **Install the editor and Lean.** Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
   and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), then add VS Code's **Lean 4**
   extension (search "Lean 4" in the Extensions panel). The first time you open
   a Lean file, the extension offers to install Lean (elan) for you. Accept.

   Prefer the terminal? On macOS or Linux, install elan directly:

   ```bash
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover/elan/master/elan-init.sh -sSf | sh
   ```

2. **Download this project:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ATOMSLab/LeanSMILES.git
   cd LeanSMILES
   ```

3. **Download the project's dependencies and Mathlib's precompiled cache, then
   check the project:**

   ```bash
   lake exe cache get
   lake build
   ```

   Mathlib is Lean's mathematics library, and it is large. `lake exe cache get`
   downloads it already compiled (several GB of disk). Without it, `lake build`
   compiles Mathlib from scratch, which takes hours. The Lean version this
   project needs (pinned in `lean-toolchain`) installs itself the first time you
   run `lake`.

4. **Try it.** In VS Code, use **File → Open Folder…** and open the whole
   `LeanSMILES` folder, not a single file, so the dataset paths resolve. Then
   open `LeanSMILES/Examples/parsercsv.lean`. The **Lean Infoview** panel on the
   right shows each `#eval` result: the solubility dataset in `datasets/`, read
   in as SMILES strings with their numeric features.
